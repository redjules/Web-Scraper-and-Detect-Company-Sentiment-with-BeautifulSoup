# Web Scraper and Detect Company Sentiment with BeautifulSoup

# Project description & approach

In this project we will collect public reviews doing webscraping with Beautiful Soup.
Then we apply EDA to Unstructured data. We will calculate word counts and character counts as well a stopwords. We will do some Natural Language Preprocessing: lowercase words, stripping removing stopwords, visualizing common words, stripping out common words and lemmatizing reviews.
Next we will use Sentiment Analysis tecniques using TextBlob. And lastly we will convert the notebooks into Python scripts.
